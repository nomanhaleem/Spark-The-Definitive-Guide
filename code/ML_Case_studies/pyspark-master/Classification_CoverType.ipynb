    "In this programming assignment, your task is to classify geographical locations according to their predicted tree cover using Gradient Boosting and Random Forest classifiers. You are expected to fill in functions that would complete this task. All of the necessary helper code is included in this notebook. However, we advise you to go over the slides, lecture material, the EdX videos and the corresponding notebooks before you attempt this Programming Assignment. You can find information about the dataset to be used in the following links:\n",

    "   * The main parameter from train Classifier are:\n",
    "      * **data** – Training dataset: RDD of LabeledPoint. Labels should take values {0, 1}.\n",
    "      * categoricalFeaturesInfo – Map storing arity of categorical features. E.g., an entry (n -> k) indicates that feature n is categorical with k categories indexed from 0: {0, 1, ..., k-1}.\n",
    "      * **loss** – Loss function used for minimization during gradient boosting. Supported: {“logLoss” (default), “leastSquaresError”, “leastAbsoluteError”}.\n",
    "      * **numIterations** – Number of iterations of boosting. (default: 100)\n",
    "      * **learningRate** – Learning rate for shrinking the contribution of each estimator. The learning rate should be between in the interval (0, 1]. (default: 0.1)\n",
    "      * **maxDepth** – Maximum depth of the tree. E.g., depth 0 means 1 leaf node; depth 1 means 1 internal node + 2 leaf nodes. (default: 3)\n",

    "   * `load(sc,path)` : The counterpart to save - load classifier from file.\n",
    "   * `predict(X)` : predict on a single datapoint (the `.features` field of a `LabeledPont`) or an RDD of datapoints.\n",
