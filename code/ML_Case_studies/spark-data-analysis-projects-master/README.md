# Spark Data Analysis Projects

These are various Apache Spark data analysis projects done in Jupyter notebooks. Some of these analyses were conducted on the [ODROID XU4 mini cluster](http://diybigdata.net/odroid-xu4-cluster/), which the more recent ones are being performed on the [Personal Compute Cluster](https://diybigdata.net/personal-compute-cluster-2019-edition/). Since the XU4 mini cluster is a significantly constrained system, the projects done there are limited in scope. If you are looking to repeat some of these projects, the Personal Compute Cluster versions are more current.
