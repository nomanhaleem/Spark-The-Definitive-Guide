# Airline Activity Analysis
This goal of this project is to study the data available from the Department of Transportation concerning flight activity and timeliness. The data for this analysis is available here at [the Bureau of Transportation Statistics site](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time).

The data for and description of these projects can be [found here](https://diybigdata.net/airline-on-time-performance-data-analysis/).

The analysis down in these notebooks use Apache Spark v2.4 or greater with the [Quantcast File System](https://github.com/quantcast/qfs) as the underlying distributed file system. The code can be easily converted to use [HDFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop) as needed.
